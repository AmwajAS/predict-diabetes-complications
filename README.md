# predict-diabetes-complications
predict diabetes complications using AI and machine learning.

## Challenge:
predict early stage diabetes complications using AI and machine learning.

## Solution:
we developed a model with the help of AI to predict the chances of developing diabetes complications in patients 7 to 10 years before the development of the complication (mainly stroke, heart attack and diabetic retinopathy) according to the patient's lifestyle, medical symptoms and OTC images. Using #GradientBoosting, #Adaboost, #KNNeigbors, #DecisionTree and #RandomForest algorithms.

## Technologies:
- Juputer Notebook
- Python
